window_size: '2000'       # Size of genomic windows that serve as input
window_overlap: '1000'    # Size of overlap between windows
genome_length: '4641652'
mincount: '10000'         # Minimal amount of spacers per bamfile. Lower get filtered out.
gene_perc: '10'           # Percent of lowest expressed genes (spacer count over all bam files) to get filtered out. windows that contain those genes get filtered out
binsize: '16'             # Binsize to bin coverage profiles (should be a power of 2)
bam_batchsize: '10'       # Size of batches of .bam files to be processed together (depends on memory)
