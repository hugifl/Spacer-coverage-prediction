dataset_name: 'Diet1_3200_1600_TU_norm_V2' # Name of the dataset

###################### Specifications ######################
window_size: '3200'       # Size of genomic windows that serve as input
window_overlap: '1600'    # Size of overlap between windows
genome_length: '4641652'
mincount: '10000'         # Minimal amount of spacers per bamfile. Lower get filtered out.
gene_perc: '15'           # Percent of lowest expressed genes or TUs (spacer count over all bam files) to get filtered out. windows that contain those genes get filtered out
binsize: '1'             # Binsize to bin coverage profiles (should be a power of 2)
bam_batchsize: '5'   #set to 5    # Size of batches of .bam files to be processed together (depends on memory, decrease batchsize if you process more windows per file)
bamfile_start: 'BSSE'       # Start of bam file names
reads_per_experiment: '10000000' # Expected amount of total aligned reads across all samples. Used to keep scale of coverage profiles constant across datasets / experiments 
normalization_unit: 'TU' # gene or TU (transcription unit)
reference_genome: 'U00096.3' # Reference genome name
